# Jason VS Dylan

A scripted Pokemon battle using Java and the EZ Graphics library. The characters were based off of my Intro to Programming I professor and teaching assistant. The cnguyen7_animator class reads off commands from .txt files under the convention of "command numbervalue duration" based on selected function for the EZImage class in the EZ library. For each command there could be multiple number values. For example "move 200 100 10" which is equivalent to the translateTo(200,100) for the duration of 10 miliseconds.
